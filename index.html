        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Jeff!</h2>
        <p>
	I have a strong passion for software development. I am working on a variety of projects that are on my Github page. I am working on a degree in computer science, I have taken a bootcamp that trained me in full-stack development and I code constantly.
	I love to code.

                <h3>Explaining the Cloud to the average person</h3>
                <h4>cloud, rain, depth</h4>
                <p>
		In today’s world there is a massive fundamental gap in what a developer who creates cloud environment knows and what the average person understands about the cloud. Just recently, I was telling my roommate how I was learning how to build the cloud and he looked at me for about 10 seconds before saying “huh?”
		<br><br>
		In order to bridge that gap, we can find ways to get down to the fundamentals of what a cloud is and how it is built and what servers are and the intricates of society. Create YouTube videos explaining the cloud, but much of this already exists, so this begs the question, is there any reason why the gap should be bridged? Perhaps this type of information was meant for the specialized being and not meant for the average person to understand. It was made simple enough for the average person to use, and I think that is enough.

                <h3>How could quantum computing change cybesecurity?</h3>
                <h4>quantum, computers, hacking</h4>
                <p>
		Quantum computers are on the horizon and whether we want to admit it, they post major security risks to the cyber environment. There are many actors who are already stealing tons of encrypted data and holding on to it on the off chance they get access to a quantum computer which would give them access to privileged data otherwise seen as unattainable.
		<br><br>
		Quantum-safe key delivery is the best option to keep data safe when quantum computers arrive on the scene. With the horizon of smaller 20 million-qubit computer breaking a 2048-bit number in a mere 8 hours, with 2040 being our most encryption based off of this 2048 bit number, it is important we realize how quickly quantum computers are developing. If technology is truly expanding at an exponential rate, we are not far off from a publicly available quantum computer.
